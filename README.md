# Deep Learning Libraries Installers for ArcGIS

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/included-frameworks.png" />
</div>

ArcGIS Pro, Server and the ArcGIS API for Python all include tools to use AI and Deep Learning to solve geospatial problems, such as feature extraction, pixel classification, and feature categorization.  This installer includes a broad collection of components, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, Fast.ai and scikit-learn, for performing deep learning and machine learning tasks, a total collection of 99 packages. These packages can be used with the [Deep Learning Training tools](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/analysis/image-analyst/deep-learning-in-arcgis-pro.htm), [interactive object detection](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/mapping/exploratory-analysis/interactive-object-detection-basics.htm), by using the [`arcgis.learn`](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/geospatial-deep-learning/) module within the ArcGIS API for Python, and directly imported into your own scripts and tools. Most of the tools in this collection will work on any machine, but common deep learning workflows require a recent NVIDIA graphics processing unit (GPU), and problem sizes are bound by available GPU memory, see [the requirements section](#requirements).

This installer adds all the included packages to the default [`arcgispro-py3` environment](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/arcpy/get-started/installing-python-for-arcgis-pro.htm) that Pro and Server both ship with, and no additional environments are necessary in order to get started using the tools. If you do create custom environments, these packages will also be included so you can use the same tools in your own custom environments as well. 

For an example of the kinds of workflows this installer and ArcGIS enables, see the [AI & Deep Learning in the UC 2020 Plenary video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI5Sv_FsPgk&feature=youtu.be&list=PLaPDDLTCmy4YwK56yHaEdtRgNUoPBiZTz)

Once you've downloaded the archive for your product, extract the Zip file to a new location, and run the Windows Installer (MSI, e.g. `ProDeepLearning.msi`) on Windows. Note that this will install the deep learning frameworks into your currently active Pro Python environment, so be sure to switch to the environment you wish to install into before running the MSI using either ArcGIS Pro's Python manager UI or on the command line with `proswap`. You'll need to extract the file (not just open the .MSI from within the Zip file) or the installer won't be able to find its contents. On Linux, extrac the .tar.gz archive, e.g. with `tar xvf <file>.tar.gz`, then run the `DeepLearning-Setup.sh` script. After installation, the archive and installer files can be deleted.


Manual Installation
--------

If you cannot use the Pro installer, you can install the libraries manually using these instructions:
  - **[Pro 2.7 Manual Installation Instructions](install-deep-learning-frameworks-manually-2-7.pdf)**
  - **[Pro 2.6 Manual Installation Instructions](install-deep-learning-frameworks-manually-2-6.pdf)**  

Additional Installation for Disconnected Environment
--------

If you will be working in a disconnected environment, download the [arcgis_dl_backbones package](https://geosaurus.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=d404fd50d05d475f8d92eedb78e1c961) and follow the instructions under the **Steps to Install** listed on the package page. The package places backbones for deep learning models in the specified install location, eliminating the need for internet access when training deep learning models in ArcGIS.


Next Steps
----------

Once you've installed the deep learning libraries, you can use the [Deep Learning Tools](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/help/analysis/image-analyst/deep-learning-in-arcgis-pro.htm) to train geospatial deep learning models. You can also find out more about the capabilities of the [arcgis.learn module](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/geospatial-deep-learning/) which provides specialized access to many geospatial models beyond those directly available as Geoprocessing tools. Finally, you can add any of the above libraries to your own workflows, by importing the packages listed below.

Requirements
------------

Most of the packages included in the Deep Learning Libraries installer will work out of the box on any machine configuration. For example, PyTorch optionally can take advantage of a GPU, but will fall back to running its calculations on the CPU if a GPU is not available. However, GPU computation is significantly faster, and some packages such as TensorFlow in this distribution only will work with a supported GPU.  CUDA, or Compute Unified Device Architecture, is a general purpose computing platform for GPUs, a requirement for current GPU backed deep learning tools.

 GPU requirement | Supported
 -----|---------------------
 GPU Type | NVIDIA with CUDA Compute Capability<sup>&ast;</sup> 3.5 minimum, 6.1 or higher recommended
 Dedicated graphics memory <sup>&dagger;</sup> | minimum: 2GB <br />recommended: 8GB, depending on the deep learning model architecture and the batch size being used

&ast; NVIDIA provides a list of [CUDA enabled products](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus#compute) and their compute capability.

&dagger; GPU memory, unlike system memory, cannot be accessed 'virtually'. If a model training consumes more GPU memory than you have available, it will fail. GPU memory is also shared across all uses of the machine, so open Pro projects with maps and other applications can limit the available memory for use with these tools.

Additional Notes
----------------

 - Though this package distributes the GPU based versions of packages, CPU versions can still be installed and used on any machine Pro supports. To install TensorFlow for the CPU, from the Python backstage you can install the `tensorflow-mkl` package to get a CPU only version.
 - This installer adds packages to the default `arcgispro-py3` environment. Any subsequent clones of that environment will also include this full collection of packages. This collection of packages is validated and tested against the version of Pro is installed alongside, and upgrades of Pro will also require reinstallation of the deep learning libraries. Note that when you upgrade the software to a new release, you'll need to uninstall the Deep Learning Libraries installation as well as Pro or Server, and reinstall the new version of this package for that release.
 - This installer is only available for ArcGIS Pro 2.6+, and ArcGIS Server 10.8.1+ -- for earlier releases, you'll need to follow the documentation for that release on installing the packages through the Python backstage or Python command prompt.
 - If you want these packages for a specific environment only, you can install the `deep-learning-essentials` package which has the same list of dependencies as a standalone conda metapackage.
